## Payments Modernization and FinTech Impact

Over my career I have focused on modernizing large scale payment ecosystems and transaction banking platforms.

### Global PAYplus (GPP)

- Contributed to core FRSD documents that define posting, settlement, routing, exception handling, rules engine behavior, and ISO 20022 message interpretation for Global PAYplus.  
- These FRSDs were used by product engineering teams to build and evolve GPP into one of the most widely adopted payment hubs in the world.  
- GPP is used by more than two hundred banks in over one hundred sixty countries and supports high value, low value, domestic, and cross border payment flows.  

### Bank of America, Enterprise Payment Hub

- Helped design the architecture and solution patterns for Bank of America’s Global PAYplus Services Platform, which consolidated multiple legacy payment engines into one enterprise payment services hub.  
- Contributed to workflows for enrichment, validation, routing, posting, settlement, exception processing, and compliance integration.  
- Supported the move to a standardized, scalable, and future ready payment infrastructure.  

### PNC Bank, Real Time Payments and Multi Rail Modernization

- Played a key role in PNC’s transformation program to move from legacy batch systems to a unified Global PAYplus based platform.  
- Designed and supported Real Time Payments (RTP) implementation, helping PNC become one of the earliest large banks in the United States to certify and go live on The Clearing House RTP network.  
- Contributed to modernization of Fedwire, SWIFT, CHIPS, ILV, and cross border FX workflows and to the decommissioning of the legacy MTS wire system.  

### Nuvono and Truist Bank

- At 3iTek, serve as one of the core architects for Nuvono, a modern cloud native payment and banking platform that is ISO 20022 native and event driven.  
- Designed microservices, posting and settlement logic, routing and enrichment flows, Kafka based orchestration, tokenization, and identity components.  
- Help lead Nuvono implementation at Truist Bank, including Zelle modernization, secure EWS integration, and readiness for RTP and FedNow.  

These efforts support billions of dollars in daily transactions and contribute directly to the modernization, resilience, and intelligence of global and United States financial infrastructure.

## Open Source and Technical Projects

I use GitHub to share reference architectures, prototype models, and learning resources in payments and AI.

### Digital Payments System Blueprint

A reference architecture for modern payment platforms that covers:

- Multi rail routing for rails such as Fedwire, SWIFT, ACH, RTP, and FedNow  
- End to end payment lifecycle diagrams  
- ISO 20022 message structures and mapping patterns  
- Compliance and fraud integration points  

Repository:
